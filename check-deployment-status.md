# Railway Deployment Status Check

## ‚úÖ Deployment Fixes Applied

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Dockerfile npm ci error** - Updated to use `npm install` instead of `npm ci` for root dependencies
2. **Dependencies alignment** - Root package.json includes all backend dependencies
3. **Build process** - Frontend builds during deployment, server starts with built assets

### Current Deployment Setup:
- **Platform**: Railway.app
- **Build Method**: Dockerfile
- **GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/Saurabh22Kumar/chatflow.git
- **Branch**: main

## üîß Next Steps for Railway Dashboard

### 1. Check Deployment Status
Go to your Railway project dashboard and check if the latest deployment is successful.

### 2. Set Environment Variables (if not already done)
```bash
# Required Environment Variables:
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
MONGO_URL=mongodb://[RAILWAY_MONGODB_CONNECTION]
FRONTEND_URL=https://[YOUR_RAILWAY_DOMAIN]
JWT_SECRET=[GENERATE_RANDOM_STRING]
EMAIL_SERVICE=resend
RESEND_API_KEY=[YOUR_RESEND_API_KEY]
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@[YOUR_DOMAIN]
```

### 3. Add MongoDB Service
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click "New Service" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "MongoDB"
3. Copy the connection string
4. Update `MONGO_URL` environment variable

### 4. Test the Deployment
Once deployed successfully:
1. Visit your Railway app URL
2. Test user registration/login
3. Test real-time chat functionality
4. Verify all features work correctly
