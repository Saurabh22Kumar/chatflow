## Technical Implementation

### Backend
- **File Upload**: Multer middleware for handling multipart form data
- **Storage**: Cloudinary for cloud file storage and optimization
- **Validation**: Server-side file type and size validation
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/files/upload-photo` - Photo upload
  - `POST /api/files/upload-file` - File upload

### Frontend
- **File Selection**: Hidden file inputs with type restrictions
- **Upload Progress**: Loading states and user feedback
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for validation errors
- **UI Components**: Custom styled file and image message bubbles

### Database Schema
```javascript
message: {
  text: String,
  type: { type: String, enum: ["text", "image", "file", "audio", "video"] },
  fileUrl: String,
  fileName: String,
  fileSize: Number,
}
```

## Configuration

### Cloudinary Setup
1. Sign up at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/)
2. Get your credentials from the dashboard
3. Update the environment variables in `/server/.env`:
   ```

   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

### File Size Limits
You can modify the size limits in `/server/controllers/fileController.js`:
```javascript
const PHOTO_SIZE_LIMIT = 100 * 1024; // 100KB
const FILE_SIZE_LIMIT = 200 * 1024;  // 200KB
```
